    <h3> About my college career</h3>

    <p>Hello! My name is joey and this is my first website. I'm currently in my junior year for computer science
        here at BSU. However, I'm probably a bit older than most of you in this class. After graduating highschool
        I began taking classes at BCC but was unsure of what I really wanted to major in. In fall of 2019 I decided
        to dive into the world of computer science for the first time. This was mainly because of my deep interest in
        computers/tech my whole life. Fast forward to today and im on track to graduate next spring!
        I look forward to the rest of this course, meeting you guys, and learning more about web and app development. </p>

        <h3> Current Courses in progress:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>

        <h3> About me outside of class</h3>
        <p> Outside of class I have so many things going on. for starters, I play guitar in two bands and I'm also an audio engineer.
            Building and running my own recording studio has always been a dream of mine. I was actually successful in
            this for a period of time after highschool, but once I began college for my degree I limited myself to only
            producing my bands music. Aside from music, I love riding motorcycles/motocross with my friends, video games, scale modeling, 
            and I'm currently assisting my friend in building a home improvment business.
